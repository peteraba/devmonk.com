### The Craftsman ###

My name is **Peter Aba** and I'm a developer since 2002. I always liked learning about my craft and believed in life long learning. 

Instead of boring you to death, here's a short list of things I truly value and believe in:

  * Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
  * Treat backing services as attached resources
  * Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
  * Scale out via the process model
  * Treat logs as event streams

..and everything else from **[12factor manifesto](http://12factor.net/)**.

### The Guy ###

From a personal perspective I love:

   * Music - especially <a href="http://peethallgatzene.tumblr.com" target="_blank">rock and metal</a>
   * Beer
   * Travelling
   * Winter sports
